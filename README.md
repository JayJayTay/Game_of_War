# Game_of_War
JavaScript Final Project making the card game of war using simple JavaScript and all that I have learned so far from JavaScript.

I had in the back of my mind of how I was going to give the card with letters (J, Q, K and A) a solid value to run logic code on for the game,
however I did not implement that idea until I have reach the point of going through with the logic. I have had to go back to add an object that 
would provide numerical values to all of the card values, including the letter values, and then I realized I would have to change all the code where 
cards are being used to accomodate the value of the cards. 5.6.2025
